# Abstract 
The petroleum sector involves hazardous environments where gases such as methane and carbon monoxide pose significant risks to worker safety. 
This project proposes an embedded-based portable kit for monitoring methane and carbon monoxide gas levels, ensuring the safety of workers in the petroleum sector.

The kit includes:
- Gas sensors for detecting methane and carbon monoxide.
- A portable embedded gateway device.
- A cloud-based platform.
- A dedicated mobile application.

The sensors are portable and rugged, enabling real-time monitoring of gas concentrations in the work environment.
